            <div id="inf1"><h3>Alec Denston</h3>Hello, my name is Alec. I'm a simple guy. I waste my time online and love to do computer shit. That includes tinkering with computer hardware, software, or learning more about computers. I love to make 3D models and maps for the Source Engine. I made this website just as a little portfolio and a reason to post some of my work here. If you would like to view some of my work, visit my Steam profile.<br/><strong>As of right now, this webpage is still being worked on!</strong></div><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/alec41000" id="steamprof">My Steam</a>
